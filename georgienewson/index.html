Before that, I studied literature at Cambridge, where I spent all my time reading philosophy. (Now I’m in a philosophy department, I do my best not to spend all my time reading novels.) I've also worked in galleries, art classes and community spaces.<br><br>I have a barely-active account on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/georgien.bsky.social">Bluesky,</a> and I sometimes write indulgently long reviews on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/georgienewson/"> Letterboxd.</a> Apart from that, I try to stay away from the virtual fiefdoms.

									<h2> PhD project:</h2>
									<p><p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 50px;">My current project considers various ways in which human collectives -- groups, markets, communications networks -- have been modelled as cognitive agents. When I’m feeling ambitious, I think of this as an attempt to write a political history of ‘hiveminds’. I am interested in the fact that the dialectic between individual and society has so often been theorised by way of a speculative individuation of society itself, and I think that these speculations are always ways to think through (or, sometimes, pointedly avoid) fundamental problems of social co-ordination.<br><br>At the moment, I’m writing about about superorganisms, H.G. Wells, the mind-life continuity thesis, and 1920s vitalism.</p>

									<h2> Published papers:</h2>
									<p><p style="float: right;"> <p style="font-size: 16px;margin: 50px"; ><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/916235"> ‘An Archival Paradise: John Wilkins’s <i>Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language</i> and Early Modern Info-Utopianism’, Utopian Studies (July 2023). </a> [Winner of the Eugenio Battisti Award] <br> <br> This is a version of my MPhil thesis. It’s about seventeenth-century ‘Universal Philosophical Languages’, which were these amazingly grandiose attempts to exhaustively ontologise the world and then encode that ontology into a linguistic structure. They’ve been interpreted as foreshadowing later logicist attempts to construct universal formalisms, but what’s interesting to me is the way that their architects - who were mainly scientists clustered around the early Royal Society - advertised them as politically revolutionary information technologies. <br><br><a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/NEWBTV.pdf">‘Between the Void and Emptiness: Ontological Paradox and Spectres of Nihilism in Alain Badiou’s <i>Being and Event</i> and Graham Priest’s <i>One</i>’, Open Philosophy (March 2023).</a><br><br>This is an attempt to make sense of two difficult philosophical projects by squashing them together. The projects are those of Alain Badiou, who claims that that ‘ontology is mathematics’, and Graham Priest, who claims that certain ontological theses are ‘true contradictions’. These claims have much more in common than just being disconcertingly unintuitive, but I like that they have that in common, too.<br><br><a href="https://academic.oup.com/camqtly/article/50/4/368/6502986">‘Weird Horizons and the Mysticism of the Unhuman in Jeff VanderMeer’s <i> Southern Reach Trilogy</i>’, The Cambridge Quarterly (January 2022).</a><br><br> This is a version of my undergraduate dissertation, which was published after winning the Cambridge Quarterly Prize. It's about the parallels between ‘new weird’ science fiction and medieval mystical writing, both of which understand themselves as engaged with the task of representing the definitionally unrepresentable. The philosopher in me was troubled by this paradox. I now see this paper as an attempt to grapple with ‘limit of thought’ problems without the resources of dialetheism.</p>

									<h2>Other stuff:</h2>
									<p><p style="font-size: 16px;margin: 50px"> I spent some time in 2024 working as a research assistant for the <a href="https://www.culturesofknowledge.org/?page_id=5"> Cultures of Knowledge</a> project at Oxford’s History department. While cataloguing correspondence by the founding members of the Royal Society, I wrote four short biographies for Early English Letters Online:<a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=robert-moray"> Robert Moray</a>,<a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=alexander-bruce"> Alexander Bruce</a>,<a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=robert-southwell"> Robert Southwell</a>, and <a href="http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=william-petty">William Petty.</a> These should be of use to anyone interested in Early Modern science and culture. I’d also highly recommend the letters themselves, which deserve to be more widely read than they are. Those from Robert Moray to Alexander Bruce should be of particular interest to anyone curious about the early Royal Society, the history of Freemasonry, Civil War politics, seventeenth-century Scottish slang, or Early Modern homosociality.</p>
